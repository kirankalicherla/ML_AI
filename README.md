Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Machine Learning:
I  uploaded Machine Learning algorithms implemented using Numpy for Regression/Classification/Clustering/Dimensionality Reduction/Anamoly Detection etc. Same can be implemented using Scikit Learn Library.

Deep Learning:
 I have uploaded the Deep Neural network Implementation using Numpy. Comparision Logistic Regression with Single layer Neural network for classification perform and How well single layer NN is outperforming the Logistic regression in case of Non Linear classification.
